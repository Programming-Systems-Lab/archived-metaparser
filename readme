To test the metaparser, run:
java psl.metaparser.Metaparser contents.xml
This will read each line from contents.xml and send it within three smart 
events with different source IDs.
To see the output tree visually, open an X-server.

It needs the following file to run properly:
psl/groupspace/impl/OracleService.class
or
psl/oracle/impl/OracleService.class

It also needs the following packages to run properly:
psl-all.jar;
xerces.jar (which can be found in ~jf367/XML4J_3_0_1)
jdom-b4.jar (which can be found in ~jf367/JDOM)

Besides that, groupspace is needed, wgcache and worklets will be needed soon.
